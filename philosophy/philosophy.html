		<p id="philBody"> Raminder Kanetkar Architect believes in bringing programmatically well resolved, structurally grounded and aesthetically pleasing buildings to the client. She believes that buildings should convey  through their layout, details and expression, the concept of  " Commodity, Firmness and Delight"<sup>1</sup>.<br><br>


		Raminder  also believes that the process of designing a building is as complex and important as it's execution and the final expression. The inception of any sound project starts with a clear understanding of the client's program needs<sup>2</sup> by the architect  who, after exploring various design solutions, evolves a creative solution that fits well with the program needs and also respects the planet. A sound design solution involves good listening and analytical skills on the part of the architect and a strong commitment on both architect and client's part to construct buildings that are respectful to the environment.
		The process of designing buildings in the current day and age also requires architects to hold hands with many stakeholders such as consultants, authorities and financial contributors, just to name a few, and this list is getting longer. The architect, therefore, has to truly become an extension of the client's team, with the client's best interest in mind, while working harmoniously with other stakeholders. This requires tremendous team playing skills.<br><br>


		Furthermore, Raminder believes that a movement towards the evidence based design<sup>3</sup> (EBD) in healthcare and other sectors necessitates the value of sound research in evolving well resolved and grounded solutions to many design problems. As building and energy codes become stringent and  LEED accreditation process more onerous, designers have to become aware of the value of research.  Intuitive solutions need to be supported by sound research in  sectors such as health care and this approach will also trickle down to other sectors. An architectural firm's ability to substantiate their designs will progressively become  important.<br><br>


		Finally, Raminder believes that the execution of projects of every scale requires tremendous co-ordination skills combined with ability to resolve critical problems in a timely manner. Delivery of projects on time an on budget is important to all clients and this aspect should be emphasised by developing clear and measurable goals for delivery for each project.<br><br>
