					<b>Project Description:</b><br>
					Gross Floor Area:   approx. 21,000sqft<br>
					This was a proposal  for  re-purposing of an existing school building in the Wentworth area of Hamilton  into transitional housing,  
					administration offices and short term accommodation for the new immigrants. The idea behind the project was to provide various services to the new immigrants, 
					including housing,  on one site. The design proposal included repurposing of the existing three storey school  structure into administrative offices and short 
					term hotel type accommodation for the new immigrants. The existing arena attached to the school was in a dilapidated shape.  The arena building  
					was to be demolished and replaced with eleven (11) traditional houses as transitional accommodation for the families of new immigrants,  until they could find a permanent place to live. <br><br>

					<b>Unique Design Features:</b><br>
					The plan arrangement for the new housing  was aimed  to foster social interaction and a feeling of community with design features such as central pedestrian access,  
					shared front yards, and colourful visible entry doors to each unit. Housing units were designed to accommodate families with kids and were designed with familiar facade 
					features found in many traditional houses in Canada.  Some facade upgrades such as replacement of the existing windows and addition of the curtain wall to the administration 
					area were  proposed for the re-purposed buildings.<br><br>

					<b>Challenges Unique to the Project:</b><br>
					There were significant budget limitations on this project.<br><br>
					
					<b>Project Involvement/Role:</b><br>
					As  Design  Architect  Raminder  was responsible for the proposal design  from start to finish.<br><br>
