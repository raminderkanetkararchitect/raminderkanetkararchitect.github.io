					<b>Project Description:</b><br>
					Gross Floor Area:   approx. 400 sq ft<br>
					This project was truly a labour of love and  very personal for Raminder Kanetkar to work on. With her growing family, the old kitchen in the house was becoming dysfunctional, confined and cluttered. 
					The appliances were not energy efficient and the growing (generation X) kids needed more space to hang around the kitchen and the family room. The plan layout for the renovated kitchen was completely 
					changed from a confined  u shape kitchen to an arrangement around  a 12'-0"X3'-6"  island,  where everyone could gather and do various tasks. The renovated kitchen,  In addition to  being a social hub,  
					now accommodates better flow, more people, larger storage space and,  with its modern clean lines, gives the feeling of openness and an expanded space. 
					Raminder lowered the kitchen ceiling to accommodate pot lights,  mood lighting fixtures and to hide existing bulkheads. She also paid special attention in selecting environmentally friendly, 
					durable and low maintenance materials for countertops (Caesarstone), flooring (Vermont slate & Maple planks),  cabinets (Architectural grade plywood) and backsplash (Back-painted glass). The same materials are carried through to the family room. 
					For furnishings she  invested in a few mid century modern classic furniture pieces such as Wassily Chairs and  Eames console tables that her family enjoys using. These classic furniture pieces are functional, 
					will never be outdated, and are conversation starters.<br><br>

					<b>Unique Design Features:</b><br>
					This project had various unique aspects in its exterior as well as interior design, some of the project's unique design features included:<br>

					<ul>
						<li>Caesarstone  island  used both as work surface and  eating area.  This material  is very easy to maintain, does not stain  and is almost indestructible.</li>
						<li>Heated  floors  in some  sections of the kitchen, such as in the eating area and in food  preparation area,  are a very useful comfort feature. Sun touch electric heating pads were used due to the limited floor depth (&frac12;"). 
						Thermostat is used to adjust and turn off the heating as required during the seasons.</li>
						<li>Two sinks were installed to accommodate the needs of all four family members working in the kitchen at the same time.</li>
						<li>Variety of storage needs are accommodated by providing a combination of open storage shelves, cabinets with pull out drawers, fixed cabinets with doors, and drawers for pots and pans. 
						The bulkheads are eliminated and cabinets are built to the ceiling space, providing additional storage. A pull out pantry on the side of stove holds all the spices and  lentils etc.</li>
						<li>A six (6) burner gas stove with a commercial style hood is appropriate  for the family's unique ethnic cooking needs.</li>
					</ul>

					<b>Challenges Unique to the Project:</b><br>
					The kitchen renovation was done while the family was living in the house.  It took about a month  to put it all together. Different trades had to be co-ordinated  very efficiently in order to finish the work on 
					time which required rigorous pre-construction planning. The family survived through the difficult renovation and enjoys the end result very much.<br><br>
					
					<b>Project Involvement/Role:</b><br>
					Raminder was successful in designing and co-ordinating the project as the lone designer and architect.<br><br>
