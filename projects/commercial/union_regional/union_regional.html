					<b>Project Description:</b><br>
					Gross Floor Area: approx. 56,000 sq ft on 1 floor<br>
					Union Gas as a company is committed to sustainable practices and employee safety. Most of their office and service centre facilities 
					are currently undergoing renovations as the buildings get older. The Waterloo facility needed a complete renovation to the interior 
					to meet the current building codes and Ontario's new accessibility standards. The exterior facade  also required upgrading to meet 
					the current energy codes. The office areas were completely renovated with the open plan layout concept for workstations, that were 
					redesigned and streamlined with UGL's current needs. Many collaborative spaces were added such as small and mid size meeting rooms, 
					training areas etc.  The main lobby area was repurposed  as the new sitting and relaxing area that employees could use during their 
					coffee breaks and for informal meetings. Washrooms and cafeteria spaces were redesigned to meet accessibility standards. 
					Employee input was valued throughout the design process.<br><br>

					<b>Unique Design Features:</b><br>
					Some of the project's unique design features included:<br>

					<i>Emphasis on Natural Light</i> - There is a direct co-relation between the employee productivity and  their access to natural light. 
					All workstations in the Waterloo office were provided direct access to the natural light. Window shades were carefully selected to block 
					off glare and for visual privacy and safety. All building lighting was upgraded with occupancy sensors and  energy efficient fixtures.<br>

					<i>Employee Safety</i> - Exterior walkways at the entrance were heated  to minimize the slip hazards. 
					Additional employee entrance with vestibule was added with direct access to the parking lot to reduce the exterior walk in the winter. <br>

					<i>Emphasis on Collaborative spaces</i> - Since the employee workstations were reduced in size, more emphasis was put on well used and designed collaborative spaces where employee interaction could take place within the office. Smaller meeting rooms could be used for confidential talks as well as  workstations  for non-permanent  staff. <br>

					<i>Technical Connectivity and wiring</i> - Many electrical and IT upgrades were provided to bring the facility to the current standards.<br><br>

					<b>Challenges Unique to the Project:</b><br>
					The facility was designed to the LEED Silver standards.  All materials were selected to meet these standards that included carpeting, paints, glazing, furniture and window shades.<br><br>
					
					<b>Project Involvement/Role:</b><br>
