					<b>Project Description:</b><br>
					Gross Floor Area: approx. 16,000 sq ft  on 1 floor<br>
					Union Gas as a company is committed to sustainable practices and employee safety. Most of their office and service centre facilities 
					are currently undergoing renovations as the buildings get older. The Chatham head office required conference and training facility.  
					The ground floor office space at 50 Keil Drive was re-purposed to accommodate this facility.  The existing core and the stair shafts were 
					maintained with the load bearing walls but the whole interior space was redesigned to accommodate meeting rooms, video conferencing spaces, 
					training rooms, storage spaces and additional  washroom areas. An extensive code review to meet the current building codes and Ontario's new 
					accessibility standards was performed. New covered exit stairs were added to the South side of the ground floor to accommodate the 
					additional occupant exiting due to the occupancy change from group 'D' (Office) to 'A' (Conference). Various furniture layouts were 
					developed to accommodate maximum flexibility in the interior meeting room layouts for multiple uses.  Building users were closely 
					involved throughout the design process. Exterior windows and foundation waterproofing was also upgraded.<br><br>

					<b>Unique Design Features:</b><br>
					Some of the project's unique design features included:<br>

					<i>Lobby upgrades</i> - The elevator lobby space was upgraded with new lighting,  a wood feature wall, wood ceiling, new flooring and paint etc.  
					to achieve a sense of arrival. A TV monitor was added  to the lobby to visually feature Union gas company announcements and employee achievements.<br>

					<i>Maximizing Access to Natural Light</i> - All meeting and training rooms were located to have direct access to natural light. <br>

					<i>Employee Safety</i> - Exterior walkways all around the ground floor were upgraded  to minimize the slip hazards and to accommodate the accessibility standards for the disableb.<br>

					<i>Acoustic privacy</i> - Since several meeting rooms and video conferencing spaces were placed next to each other, acoustic privacy was provided by taking 
					all partition walls to the underside of the slab above. Additional measures to implement  acoustic privacy are discussed in the following section.<br>

					<i>Technical Connectivity and wiring</i> - Many electrical and IT upgrades were provided to bring the facility to the current standards. 
					TV monitors and high tech sound equipment was accommodated in video conferencing rooms in custom millwork. All wiring was hidden in trenches in concrete floors.<br><br>

					<b>Challenges Unique to the Project:</b><br>
					Acoustic privacy and lighting were two of the most important challenges in this project. An acoustic consultant was hired  to evaluate  the required STC ratings for the walls. 
					In addition, due to significant  increase in the building occupants, a new HVAC unit had to be installed for fresh air supply.<br>
					<ul>
						<li>Staggered stud construction with acoustic insulation was followed for most partition walls between meeting rooms.</li>
						<li>Acoustic Sealant  was applied to all joints at floors and ceilings.</li>
						<li>Wood acoustic panels were provided in the video conferencing  spaces to minimize echo.</li>
						<li>All doors to the meeting rooms were acoustic doors with drop seals and  with double side glazing.</li>
						<li>Since there was no sprinkler system in the building, change of occupancy required ground floor to be divided into fire compartments of 6000sqft each (as/OBC2006). 
						Mechanical and electrical penetrations had to be carefully monitored for the integrity of fire ratings and acoustic privacy in the fire compartment walls.</li>
						<li>A new mechanical room was added  to the South side to accommodate additional air handling unit to provide fresh air supply for the increased occupants.
						The facility was designed to the LEED Silver standards.  All materials were selected to meet these standards that included carpeting, paints, glazing, furniture and window shade.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<b>Project Involvement/Role:</b><br>
					As a Project Design Architect/Manager a significant responsibility of running and designing the project from start to finish.  Working directly with the client :<br>
					<ul>
						<li>The concept design for interior as well as exterior</li>
						<li>Exterior facade and canopy design & details</li>
						<li>Interior space design and details</li>
						<li>Production and co-ordination of design drawings and tender documents,</li>
						<li>Responsible for all consultant co-ordination including structure,  M&E, LEED and Cost</li>
						<li>Construction monitoring and shop drawings</li>
					</ul>
