					<b>Project Description:</b><br>
					Gross Floor Area:   approx. 190,000 sq ft  on 6 floors<br>
					The research building is 6 storeys above grade with a mechanical penthouse above the 6th storey.  The building accommodates but 
					is not limited to Offices and  wet and dry research labs with a maximum projected containment level of 2.  The building is served 
					by a central core containing washrooms, an elevator lobby with 2 passenger elevators and a feature stair; a smaller side core 
					containing 1 freight elevator, service shafts and an exit stair, and 2 mini-cores at the north and south ends of the building providing 
					additional exit stairs.  The west side of the building, which houses the office and administrative functions, is clad with glass in 
					curtain-wall sections which is largely transparent, bringing in natural light and views.  The design intent was to create a strong 
					physical and visual link between the interior and landscaped exterior spaces.  The east side of the building is clad with glass spandrel 
					panels in curtain-wall sections providing opaque contrast to the glazed elements.  A regular horizontal rhythm of punched windows accommodates 
					a fixed lab module on the fourth and fifth levels.  A central light well separating the east and west portions of the building and containing 
					interactive hubs provides opportunity for interaction throughout the various levels, while providing daylight to interior spaces.  No additional 
					parking is provided for the proposed research building as it is part of the Hamilton General Hospital Campus.  Loading and waste handling is 
					through one common entry point off Victoria Avenue.  The structure is reinforced concrete.  Floor to floor heights are 4600mm for all levels.  
					The building structural bay is 9144mm (30’) on a standard laboratory module of 1575mm (5’).<br><br>

					<b>Unique Design Features:</b><br>
					This project had various unique aspects in its exterior as well as interior design, some of the project's unique design features included:<br>

					<ul>
						<li>A unique exterior and interior glass canopy , a stepped exterior patio,  and  a steel and glass railing were designed to connect 
						a  half storey high awkwardly placed building entrance to grade.  Use of modern materials create a smooth transition giving the building 
						a slick high tech appearance. An aluminum curtain wall system was used on all sides to complete the modern appearance of the building</li>
						<li>The design of a continuous aluminum skylight system on a five storey high interior atrium space on top of  a well lit two storey 
						high large interactive space towards the west side, helps bring ample day light in to the center of a relatively wide floor plate of the CVSRI building.</li>
						<li>A five storey high open feature central stair and smaller open meeting spaces located at the North and South ends of the 
						building create opportunities for chance social interaction for the researchers and scientists working in this building.</li>
					</ul>

					<b>Challenges Unique to the Project:</b><br>
					This was a public private partnership (P3) project that created a challenge of balancing the building design with many cost cutting measures for the entire design team. 
					For example, the metal panels on the exterior facade were replaced with spandrel glass in order to lower building cost. The design team had to judicially 
					select many such alternative solutions to meet the budget.<br> 

					Also unique to this project was the strict production schedule that had to be adhered to. The client (Hamilton Health Science) was pleased with the final outcome and the building users enjoy the space.<br><br>
					
					<b>Project Involvement/Role:</b><br>
					From the project Inception to the Tender stage  involved in the capacity of Project Leader with:<br>
					<ul>
						<li>The design development</li>
						<li>Contract Documents</li>
						<li>Exterior facade and canopy design</li>
						<li>Landscape design</li>
						<li>Production and co-ordination of  drawings</li>
						<li>Consultant co-ordination </li>
					</ul>
