					<b>Project Description:</b><br>
					Gross Floor Area:   approx. 105,000 sq ft  on 2 floors<br>
					Waterloo North Hydro Service and Administration Center was designed with a significant input from the client group,  
					who where directly involved with the office and overall building design process. The emphasis throughout Design Development/Sketch Plan phase was to incorporate 
					significant facility staff input in creating a logical and principled organization that can evolve through to the next steps of implementation. From all perspectives, 
					the emphasis was to make meaningful, prudent & aesthetically pleasing design decisions to accommodate the activities taking place in the new Administration and Service Centre in a sustainable manner.<br><br>

					<b>Unique Design Features:</b><br>
					Some of the project's unique design features included:<br>
					<i>Connectivity</i>  - Due to the nature of functional activities taking place on the administration and industrial sides, some of which take place on a 24/7 basis, it was imminent to separate 
					each major department from one another but was also important to maintain a feeling of openness and connectivity throughout the entire building. Many recent studies prove that light filled visually 
					pleasing interiors boost employee productivity. One of the design team’s objectives was to develop a design that maintains a general feeling of well being and fosters interaction between building users. 
					<i>An internal open central street</i> concept was adopted & all interconnected spaces were designed along this linear street. 
					<i>Advanced Sustainable Design features</i> - Geothermal heating and cooling, Rainwater collection and storage tanks for flushing the toilets and washing WNH vehicles &, 
					enhanced envelope design with the use of fiberglass windows <i>Photovoltaic Panels</i> - Possibility of harvesting sun's energy through use of Photovoltaic panels to heat water and to generate electricity is under review.<br><br>

					<b>Challenges Unique to the Project:</b><br>
					<i>Staff safety and Indoor air quality:</i> Due to the nature of service provided to the region, a large area of the WNH’s new site and building are used to store service vehicles and hydro related materials and goods. 
					Continuous maintenance, care and running of the service vehicles, housed in the same building as the administration staff,  presented its own set of challenges from the perspective of staff safety and indoor air quality. 
					Service goods on the other hand, often delivered and picked up through large vehicles, required delivery and storage areas designed to allow for large vehicular access.<br><br>
					
					<i>Design for Future Expansion:</i>  In addition, the WNH executives and design team explored future expansion opportunities in order to ensure that the current design and building placement were in line with and 
					supportive of future developments in the administrative and industrial sides. Both current and potential future addition requirements will respond to the site and building access, interior circulation, security, physical function 
					and at the same time meet the applicable (OBC & LEED silver.) codes and standards.<br><br>
					
					<b>Project Involvement/Role:</b><br>
					As a Project Design Architect/Manager a significant responsibility of running and designing the project from start to finish.  Working directly with the client :<br>
