					<b>Project Description:</b><br>
					<i>Atlanta, GA, November 11, 2005 – The winners of the EGB Design Competition were announced during the LEED Certification Ceremony at Greenbuild 2005. 
					Intern Architect Raminder Kanetkar and teammate Jixian Hu won first place in the "Natural Talent Design Competition," New Construction category. 
					Both Kanetkar and Hu were employed with Canadian firm, Adamson Associates Architects.<br><br>

					The USGBC Natural Talent 2005 Design Competition provides an applied learning experience in the principles of integrated design, sustainability, 
					innovation, and social consciousness; all of which are components of the LEED Green Building Rating System. Working with Boys & Girls Clubs of America, 
					USGBC selected two planned Boys & Girls Club projects as the subjects of this year’s competition.<br><br>
 
					The team’s winning entry, "Sustainable Connectivity" is the theme behind the design of the Boys and Girls Club of America. The idea of physical, 
					visual and environmental connectivity is expressed in design through interior spaces having visual and physical links to outside green spaces 
					throughout the building, maximizing the potential for natural light, thermal comfort and views. The aim is to create a positive, hopeful, 
					cheerful and comfortable learning environment.<br><br>

					The final judging responses to the winning design were: "A  thoughtful integration of passive systems design. Beautifully sighted. 
					Good integration of interior and exterior. Very good program organization. Wonderful renderings combined with diagrams. 
					Very clear presentation." The interior spaces were cited by the judges as, "Very inviting that children would truly enjoy."</i><br><br>

					<b>Unique Design Features:</b><br>
					The idea of connectivity is expressed into the interior layout through visual links and layering of the strategic spaces. 
					The vertical visual connection between entrance foyer and art display area or visual link between the gymnasium and multipurpose room echo this idea. 
					The aim is to achieve an open, safe and comfortable learning and play environment that fosters participation, creativity and hope in youth coming from disadvantaged circumstances.<br>

					The sustainable physical environment remains a constant, essential and silent backdrop, be it classrooms on the South with ample natural light, 
					a gymnasium on the North with high glazing, play spaces that open on to an intimate and quiet interior court or the exterior 
					rainwater collection pond that uses a natural filtration system of fish and plants and also functions as a focal point for the outdoor gathering space. 
					The building design that relies mainly on passive elements to respond to various LEED categories also includes:<br>

					<ul>
						<li>Deep overhangs and  exterior wood screens for shading that also help unify the building visually;</li>
						<li>Operable windows for natural ventilation;</li>
						<li>An extensive green roof that has many benefits;</li>
						<li>A living wall to improve the indoor environmental quality that also acts a prominent design feature in the  entrance lobby</li>
					</ul>

					<b>Challenges Unique to the Project:</b><br>
					The first round of competition concluded on 15th of July 2005  with the selection of five finalists from each category. 
					The designs in the first round had to respond to a given program and to six LEED categories, using only one presentation board. 
					The selected finalists were required to work on a second presentation board with additional details and material information. 
					The finalists were also asked to explore three more LEED categories at their own discretion. The competition drew 100 entries, half of which came from outside the United States.<br><br>
