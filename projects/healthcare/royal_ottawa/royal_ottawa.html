					<b>Project Description:</b><br>
					The Royal Ottawa Psychiatric Hospital building is 3 storeys above grade structure with a mechanical penthouse above the  roof Level.  
					The building accommodates patient rooms, cafeteria, consultation rooms, a series of exam rooms,  offices and an auditorium arranged around 
					a series of courtyards and  glassed  in atrium spaces  to maximize light.  The facility was planned on a 9mx9m structural grid to maximize 
					flexibility in the use of interior spaces. The exterior and interior building materials were carefully selected to suit the building users 
					sensitive needs. The building is fully accessible, has a number of  exit stair towers spread through the layout and also has a prominent main entrance canopy.<br><br>

					<b>Unique Design Features:</b><br>
					This project had various unique aspects in its exterior as well as interior design,  some of which have been discussed below:<br>
					<ul>
						<li>The project was designed for psychiatric patients and a feeling of calmness and security were important features for all spaces. 
						A fairly large and square floor plate was punctured with a series of open courtyards and atrium spaces to serve as calming areas with a contact with nature. Controlled entries were provided to these spaces for patient security.</li>
						<li>A sense of arrival to the facility was achieved through a curved entrance canopy with contrasting materials to the main hospital building.</li>
						<li>The main exterior facade material was kept as brick to match the surrounding structures and  to give this large complex a more residential feeling.</li>
					</ul>

					<b>Challenges Unique to the Project:</b><br>
					This was a public private partnership (P3) project  that was large in scale and involved three different architectural firms to design and do contract documents for various 
					components of the building. Parkin Architects , Brisbin Brook Beynon (BBB) and Adamson Associates Architects (AAA) were involved to design and build interior spaces, auditorium 
					and exterior facade components with Ellis Don and Carillion in joint venture. The biggest challenge was in the co-ordination of different components including engineering and building design. 
					All this was successfully handled through a series of co-ordination meetings between different firms and  the consultants involved.<br><br>
					
					<b>Project Involvement/Role:</b><br>
					As a Job Captain,  Raminder Kanetkar was responsible for  the design and contract documents of various building components such as the atrium,  exterior canopy and exit stairs etc.
