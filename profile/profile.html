		Raminder Kanetkar, the practice owner and principal comes with extensive background in architecture with over 20 years of experience. She has worked on projects of very large size as prime consulting team member, down to small renovations in Canada and other countries. This experience has given her the ability to design and manage projects of every scale and size. 
		Using her design, project management and technical skills,  Raminder has a portfolio of many worthy projects in Institutional, Commercial,  HealthCare and Residential sectors. She wants her firm to provide the clients with high quality design and project management services in an economical way.  Raminder defines high quality design and management service as "design that suits client's program needs and has evolved by doing sound research, combined with a project that is well coordinated and is delivered on time and on budget."<br><br>

		Ms. Kanetkar graduated from the Chandigarh College of Architecture (CCA),  a school started by the great 20th century modernist architect Le Corbusier, in India with a Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch.) degree in 1982. She worked in Chandigarh for a few years and then came to study at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Canada, for Master of Advanced Studies in Architecture (MASA) degree.<br><br>

		After finishing her education in Canada, she worked in the industry with many small architectural firms, and  taught environmental design course at the University of Guelph.  She  acquired her refined design, project management and technical skills by working with a large well established firm like Adamson Associates Architects in Toronto and with environmental design firms in Hamilton and Kitchener areas. She worked continuously for about 11 years and then established her own Architectural practice in Guelph, Ontario in 2010,  where is currently lives with her family.<br><br>
 
		In addition to focussing on high quality design and project delivery  at a reasonable cost, Raminder has the capability to bring value to the client by offering value added services like Sustainable Design & LEED facilitation, Interior design, Programming & Universal Design consultations as part of one package.<br><br>
